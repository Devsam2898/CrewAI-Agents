# MIT Physics Questions Answering Project

This project demonstrates the utilization of CrewAI agents, specifically a customized `PDFSearchTool`, with Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model as the language model (LLM) and Cohere's `embed-english-v3.0` for embeddings. The goal of the project is to assess the undergraduate proficiency of the model by using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on a dataset of MIT physics questions.

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to leverage advanced AI models to answer undergraduate-level physics questions from the MIT dataset. By combining CrewAI agents with state-of-the-art LLM and embedding models, we aim to evaluate the proficiency of these models in understanding and solving physics problems.

## Project Structure
- **agents/**: Contains the CrewAI agents and customized `PDFSearchTool`.
- **data/**: Directory for the MIT physics questions dataset.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for experiments and evaluations.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data processing and model evaluation.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mit-physics-qa.git
   cd mit-physics-qa
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install specific versions of problematic packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy==1.26.4
   ```

### Configuration

Ensure you have the necessary API keys for Anthropic and Cohere. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
```

## Usage

### Running the Model

1. Load the dataset and preprocess it:
   ```python
   python scripts/preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. Customize the `PDFSearchTool`:
   ```python
   from crewai_tools import PDFSearchTool
   from anthropic import AnthropicClient
   from cohere import CohereClient

   claude_model = AnthropicClient(api_key="your_anthropic_api_key", model="claude-3-5-sonnet")
   cohere_embedder = CohereClient(api_key="your_cohere_api_key", model="embed-english-v3.0")

   tool = PDFSearchTool(
       config=dict(
           llm=claude_model,
           embedder=cohere_embedder
       )
   )
   ```

3. Use the tool to answer physics questions:
   ```python
   from notebooks.answer_questions import answer_questions

   results = answer_questions(tool, "data/mit_physics_questions.pdf")
   print(results)
   ```

## Results
The results of the project demonstrate the capabilities of the combined models in answering undergraduate-level physics questions. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the `notebooks/results.ipynb`.
